## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn or pnpm
- A Kinda free account and configuration
- A free neo4j instanse

### Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dharayush7/adbookify.git
```

# Installation

#### 1. Installing dependencies:
```bash
cd adbookify
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm i
```


## Firebase Setup
Create a free account of Firebase.

#### 2. Create project:
Create a new project in firebase. Add web app in this app.

#### 3. Utlity Setup:
don't copy firebase config now. Go to build section and go firestore database. Activate this utlity.

#### 4. Rules configure:
- Go to rules section in firestore database.
- The default rule look like this.

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // This rule allows anyone with your Firestore database reference to view, edit,
    // and delete all data in your Firestore database. It is useful for getting
    // started, but it is configured to expire after 30 days because it
    // leaves your app open to attackers. At that time, all client
    // requests to your Firestore database will be denied.
    //
    // Make sure to write security rules for your app before that time, or else
    // all client requests to your Firestore database will be denied until you Update
    // your rules
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2024, 8, 2);
    }
  }
}
```
- Now the change the last line ```allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2024, 8, 2);``` to ```allow read, write: if true;```

- Now the rule look like this

``` 
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // This rule allows anyone with your Firestore database reference to view, edit,
    // and delete all data in your Firestore database. It is useful for getting
    // started, but it is configured to expire after 30 days because it
    // leaves your app open to attackers. At that time, all client
    // requests to your Firestore database will be denied.
    //
    // Make sure to write security rules for your app before that time, or else
    // all client requests to your Firestore database will be denied until you Update
    // your rules
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 5. Copy Cofigurarion:

- Go to project overview settings icon and click project settings.
- Under the section "your app" the default app was selected.
- Now copy "firebaseConfig" . 
- The firebaseConfig look like this
```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: // api id,
  authDomain:  // auth domain,
  databaseURL:  // database url,
  projectId: // project ID,
  storageBucket: // strorage Bucket,
  messagingSenderId: // Messaging sender id,
